ðŸŽ® AI Atari Games â€“ Reinforcement Learning Projects

This project was originally created in June 2023 during my exploration of reinforcement learning techniques.

These classic control and grid-based environments like CartPole, MountainCar, FrozenLake, CliffWalking, and Acrobot are used to train AI agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The agent learns to play these games by interacting with the environment â€” taking actions, receiving rewards, and improving its strategy over time to maximize long-term success. These projects demonstrate how AI can learn optimal behavior in uncertain and dynamic environments through trial and error.
